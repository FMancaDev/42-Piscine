# 42 Piscine

This repository is dedicated to consolidating everything I‚Äôve learned during my Piscine journey at 42. It‚Äôs also meant to be a helpful resource for both new and returning Pisciners who are embarking on this unique and intense learning experience.

## Navigating the Piscine 

### Keep Swimming Forward üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
In the Piscine, progress is what matters most. Focus on learning and don't worry about making everything perfect. Avoid getting stuck on a single project for too long; the key is to keep advancing and absorbing as much as you can. If an exercise feels too challenging, it‚Äôs perfectly fine to skip it and revisit later with more experience. Often, this approach helps solidify the concepts more effectively.

### Stay Honest - Choose Real Learning üéì
How can you solve something when you have no idea where to start? The answer: **use resources wisely**. But remember, copying answers directly won‚Äôt help you in the long run‚Äîunderstanding how and why something works is where the real learning happens.

## My Learning Method

```c
void my_learning_method() {
    // Passo 1: Tente o b√°sico por conta pr√≥pria
    create_basic_structure();

    // Passo 2: Quando estiver travado, busque solu√ß√µes semelhantes
    while (!understood) {
        if (stuck) {
            find_similar_solutions();
            analyze_code();

            if (understanding_code) {
                write_code_yourself();
            } else {
                transcribe_code();
                test_and_debug_code();

                if (still_confused) {
                    use_debugging_tools();
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Passo 3: A repeti√ß√£o leva √† compreens√£o
    if (repeated_enough) {
        knowledge_consolidated();
    }
}
```

## How To Work During The Exam

### Available Commands
- `status`: Shows the remaining time and current status of the exam.
- `grademe`: Evaluates the exercise you submitted.
- `finish`: Ends the examshell and completes your exam.

### Steps to Follow
1. Open a new terminal or editor (ex., VSCode, Vim).

2. Access the directory containing the exam subjects.
   - The subjects are located in the `subject` directory.

3. Create a new folder in the `Rendu` directory with the name of the project.
   ```bash
   mkdir Rendu/<project_name>
   cd Rendu/<project_name>
   ```
4. Write your solution inside this folder.

### Step 6Ô∏è‚É£: Submitting Your Work.
1. Once you finish the project, navigate to the `Rendu` directory and run:

   ```bash
   git add <project_name>
   git commit -m "Submit <project_name>"
   git push
   ```
2. Return to the examshell and type `grademe` to evaluate your project.

## Tips and Tricks
- Always check the remaining time using the `status` command.
- Save your work frequently to avoid data loss.
- Use debugging tools to understand errors and improve your code.
- If you are stuck, re-read the subject and focus on understanding the requirements.
Good luck with your exam!
