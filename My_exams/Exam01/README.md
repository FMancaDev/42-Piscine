### Attention

Although the exercises in this repository are **not exactly** the same as the ones you will encounter in the 42 exams, they are **based on similar problems**. The idea is to provide relevant practice so that you get a sense of the challenges you will face in the exams, while also helping to consolidate the knowledge you've gained.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to keep track of the exercises I completed during the exam and the grades I received. These exercises were based on key topics covered during the **Piscine**, and they provide a solid foundation for more advanced work.
