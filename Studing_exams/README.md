# 42 Piscine Exams Practice

This repository is dedicated to the **study and practice** of exercises completed during the **Piscine** at 42. Here, you will find solutions to various exercises and projects that were undertaken to solidify the knowledge acquired throughout the course.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to consolidate everything I've learned during the **Piscine** and provide a useful resource for both new and returning **pisciners**. Throughout the repository, you will find a variety of **exercises and solutions**, as well as some tips and tricks that may help with your learning.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

### Attention

Although the exercises in this repository are **not exactly** the same as the ones you will encounter in the 42 exams, they are **based on similar problems**. The idea is to provide relevant practice so that you get a sense of the challenges you will face in the exams, while also helping to consolidate the knowledge you've gained.

### How to Navigate the Repository

1. **Choose an exercise**: Each directory within the `Studing_exams` folder corresponds to a set of exercises.
2. **Check the solution**: Inside each directory, you will find the solution to the exercise, along with details on how I approached the problem and the implementation.
3. **Practice**: Feel free to try solving the exercises on your own, reviewing the solutions when necessary.

## Study Tips

During the **Piscine**, it‚Äôs important to stay focused on learning. Here are some tips that helped me during my journey:

- **Don‚Äôt be afraid to make mistakes**: Mistakes are part of the learning process. Solve problems on your own and, if needed, review the solution.
- **Don‚Äôt focus on perfection**: The goal is to understand the concept, not to write perfect code right away.
- **Use debugging tools**: Tools like **gdb**, **valgrind**, and the **VS Code Debugger** are extremely helpful for understanding errors and improving your code.
- **Study with peers**: Sharing ideas and discussing solutions with other pisciners is a great way to learn faster.

## How to Contribute

If you found any errors or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an **issue** or submit a **pull request**. I‚Äôm always open to suggestions and improvements!
